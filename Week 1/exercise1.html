 <p>Thomas John Watson Sr. (February 17, 1874 – June 19, 1956) was an American businessman who served as the chairman and CEO of IBM.[1][2]
    He oversaw the company's growth into an international force from 1914 to 1956. Watson developed IBM's management style and corporate 
culture from John Henry Patterson's training at NCR.[3] He turned the company into a highly effective selling organization,
 based largely on punched card tabulating machines. A leading self-made industrialist,[4] he was one of the richest men of his time 
 and was called the world's greatest salesman when he died in 1956.</p>
