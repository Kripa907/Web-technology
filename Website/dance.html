                                <p>Tahote(Thote) is a ritualistic festival of the Tamu Gurung people, performed to forbid the entry of evil energies into the village community. It aims to address ritual ceremonies as the beginning of all power and energy to shape the village for the better, by warding off any unseen, unfavorable influence from the outside. We can be fairly certain that this tradition predates Tamu Gurung’s conversion to Buddhism.</p>
